This project is a front-end clone of the popular streaming service Netflix. It replicates the user interface of the Netflix web application using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The goal of this clone is to recreate the look and feel of Netflix's home page and demonstrate proficiency in front-end development.

1- Responsive Design: The layout adapts to different screen sizes, offering a consistent viewing experience across devices.

2- Horizontal Scrolling Carousels: Multiple rows of movies/shows displayed as carousels that can be scrolled horizontally, giving it the classic Netflix browsing experience.

3- Hover Effects: Interactive effects that show more details about a movie/show when hovering over thumbnails.

## Tech Stack üíª

1- HTML: For the structure and layout of the page.

2- CSS: For styling and layout, including Flexbox for positioning elements.


## Pages Included üìÑ

## Purpose & Learning Outcome üìö

This Netflix clone project provided an opportunity to enhance my skills in front-end web development, specifically focusing on UI/UX design and responsive layouts. Through this project, I practiced implementing modern CSS techniques like Flexbox and Grid, as well as creating interactive elements with JavaScript. This project gave me hands-on experience in building a professional-looking user interface similar to a popular real-world application.
